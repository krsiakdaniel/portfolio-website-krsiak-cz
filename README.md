## ⚡ Project Website

Website: <https://krsiak.cz>

## ✏️ Project Description

- A portfolio website showcasing my work and skills as **React Developer** building web applications using **TypeScript**, **React** and **Next.js**.
- Workflows are automated and the project is deployed using **CI/CD** pipelines.

## 👨‍💼 Team Leadership and Task Management

I have extensive experience in creating boards in **Trello**, **Jira**, **GitHub Projects**, and **GitLab**. I excel at organizing tasks for both individual and team projects, ensuring efficient workflows and timely project completion. I have managed projects in teams ranging from 3 people / 10 people / 40 people across 4 different teams and time zones.

## 📈 Project Board and Issues

To keep track of the project's progress and manage tasks efficiently, I use a project board with issues.

- [Issues](https://github.com/krsiakdaniel/portfolio-website-krsiak-cz/issues)

## 📊 Insights and Analytics
