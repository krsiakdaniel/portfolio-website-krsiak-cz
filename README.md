## ⚡ Project Website

Website: <https://krsiak.cz>

## ✏️ Project Description

- A portfolio website showcasing my work and skills as **React Developer** building web applications using **TypeScript**, **React** and **Next.js**.
- Workflows are automated and the project is deployed using **CI/CD** pipelines.

## 👨‍💼 Team Leadership and Task Management

I have extensive experience in creating boards in **Trello**, **Jira**, **GitHub Projects**, and **GitLab**. I excel at organizing tasks for both individual and team projects, ensuring efficient workflows and timely project completion.

**I managed projects of different sizes:**

- Teams of 3, 10, and 40 members.
- Collaboration across 4 teams and multiple time zones.

## 📈 Project Board and Issues

To keep track of the project's progress and manage tasks efficiently, I use a project board with issues.

- [Project board](https://github.com/users/krsiakdaniel/projects/6)
- [Issues](https://github.com/krsiakdaniel/portfolio-website-krsiak-cz/issues)

## 🔄 Pull Requests

I organize pull requests to ensure a clear and efficient workflow. See the details in closed pull requests.

- [Closed 'Pull Requests'](https://github.com/krsiakdaniel/portfolio-website-krsiak-cz/pulls?q=is%3Apr+is%3Aclosed)

## 📊 Insights and Analytics

To provide a clear overview of the project's progress I use charts.

- [Labels Overview](https://github.com/users/krsiakdaniel/projects/6/insights/3)
- [Priorities](https://github.com/users/krsiakdaniel/projects/6/insights/2)
- [Trend of Tasks](https://github.com/users/krsiakdaniel/projects/6/insights/1)

## 🐛 Handling Unexpected Bugs

I follow a structured approach to identify and resolve unexpected issues.

1. **Problem Analysis**
2. **Root Cause Identification**
3. **Proposing Solutions**
4. **Testing the Fix**
5. **Documenting the Process**

Explore link below to see how I apply this in practice:
