## ‚ÑπÔ∏è Info

The entire process and information is visible on GitHub on pull request page.

### The Process

1. **Pull Request Initiation**

   - The process starts on a **pull request** made from the `master` branch.

2. **[README: üõ†Ô∏è Continuous Integration](README-continuous-integration.md)**

   - GitHub Actions run the following workflows:
     - `jest.yml` - **Unit** tests
     - `playwright.yml` - **E2E** tests
     - `prettier-check-formatting.yml` - **Prettier** checks formatting
     - `auto-author-assign.yml` - **Auto-assign** pull request to author
     - `labeler.yml` - **Labeler** labels pull request

3. **Test Artifacts Creation**

   - After the workflow completes:
     - Go to the Actions tab in the GitHub repository.
     - Find the last workflow run that was triggered.
     - In the ‚ÄúArtifacts‚Äù section, you‚Äôll see your uploaded artifact.
     - You can download it directly from there in ZIP format.

4. **[README: ‚úÖ Continuous Deployment](README-continuous-deployment.md)**

   - Netlify creates a **Deploy Preview** of the website.

5. **CI & CD Validation**

   - CI and CD should pass with no errors.
   - If there are any issues, a fix must be made, and the process starts again.

6. **Review and Test Changes**

   - Review and test the changes on the **Deploy Preview** link.
   - If there are any issues, a fix must be made, and the process starts again.

7. **Approval and Merge**

   - All changes should be reviewed and approved.
   - Use **Squash and merge** to keep the history clean.
   - Merge the **pull request** to the `master` branch.

8. **Post-Merge Actions**
   - The branch is automatically deleted.
   - The **Production Build** starts on **merge** to the `master` branch.
   - Once finished, the **website automatically deploys** to production.
