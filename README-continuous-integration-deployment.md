## üõ†Ô∏è CI - Continuous Integration

This app uses GitHub Actions for CI.

### Status

[![Jest Tests](https://github.com/krsiakdaniel/portfolio-website-krsiak-cz/actions/workflows/jest.yml/badge.svg)](https://github.com/krsiakdaniel/portfolio-website-krsiak-cz/actions/workflows/jest.yml) [![Playwright Tests](https://github.com/krsiakdaniel/portfolio-website-krsiak-cz/actions/workflows/playwright.yml/badge.svg)](https://github.com/krsiakdaniel/portfolio-website-krsiak-cz/actions/workflows/playwright.yml)

### GitHub Actions

Workflows are defined in `.github/workflows` directory.

#### Workflow for Jest üÉè

- Workflow file: [jest.yml](.github/workflows/jest.yml)
- View the results on GitHub: [actions/workflows/jest.yml](https://github.com/krsiakdaniel/portfolio-website-krsiak-cz/actions/workflows/jest.yml)

---

This workflow is triggered in 2 scenarios:

1. When a push is made to the `master` branch.
2. When a pull request is opened against the `master` branch.

The workflow consists of a single job named `build`, which is executed on the latest version of Ubuntu.

The `build` job follows these steps:

1. Checkout the repository using the `actions/checkout@v3` action.
2. Setup Node.js environment using the `actions/setup-node@v3` action with Node.js version 18.
3. It installs the dependencies of your project using `npm ci`. This command is similar to `npm install`, but it's designed to be used in automated environments such as this one.
4. Run JEST tests using `npm test`.
5. Upload the test report as an artifact:
   - Using the `actions/upload-artifact@v3` action.
   - This step is always executed regardless of the success or failure of previous steps.
   - The artifact is named `jest-report`
   - It is located at path `jest-report/`
   - It is retained for 7 days.
