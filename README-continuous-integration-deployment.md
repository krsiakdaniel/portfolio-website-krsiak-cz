## ‚ÑπÔ∏è CI/CD Process

The entire process and information is visible on GitHub when pull request is made.

1. The process starts on **pull request** made from `master` branch.
2. **CI** - GitHub Actions run **Unit** tests and **E2E** tests.
3. **Test artifacts** are created:
   1. After the workflow completes, go to the Actions tab in GitHub repository.
   2. Find the last workflow run that was triggered.
   3. In the ‚ÄúArtifacts‚Äù section, you‚Äôll see your uploaded artifact.
   4. You can download it directly from there in ZIP.
4. **CD** - Netlify creates a **Deploy Preview** of the website.
5. CI and CD should pass with no errors ‚úÖ
   1. If there are any issues, fix must be made.
   2. Process starts again.
6. **Review and test the changes** on the **Deploy Preview** link ‚úÖ
   1. If there are any issues, fix must be made.
   2. Process starts again.
7. All should be reviewed and approved ‚úÖ
8. Now **pull request** can be merged to `master` branch.
9. Branch is automatically deleted.
10. The **Production Build** starts on **merge** to `master` branch.
11. Auto publish is enabled, so the **website** is **automatically deployed** to production.

## üõ†Ô∏è CI - Continuous Integration

This app uses GitHub Actions for CI.

### Status of CI

[![Jest Tests](https://github.com/krsiakdaniel/portfolio-website-krsiak-cz/actions/workflows/jest.yml/badge.svg)](https://github.com/krsiakdaniel/portfolio-website-krsiak-cz/actions/workflows/jest.yml) [![Playwright Tests](https://github.com/krsiakdaniel/portfolio-website-krsiak-cz/actions/workflows/playwright.yml/badge.svg)](https://github.com/krsiakdaniel/portfolio-website-krsiak-cz/actions/workflows/playwright.yml)

### GitHub Actions

Workflows are defined in `.github/workflows` directory.

#### Workflow for Jest üÉè

- Workflow file: [jest.yml](.github/workflows/jest.yml)
- View the results on GitHub: [actions/workflows/jest.yml](https://github.com/krsiakdaniel/portfolio-website-krsiak-cz/actions/workflows/jest.yml)

<details>

---

This workflow is triggered in 2 scenarios:

1. When a push is made to the `master` branch.
2. When a pull request is opened against the `master` branch.

The workflow consists of a single job named `build`, which is executed on the latest version of Ubuntu.

The `build` job follows these steps:

1. Checkout the repository using the `actions/checkout@v3` action.
2. Setup Node.js environment using the `actions/setup-node@v3` action with Node.js version 18.
3. It installs the dependencies of your project using `npm ci`. This command is similar to `npm install`, but it's designed to be used in automated environments such as this one.
4. Run JEST tests using `npm test`.
5. Upload the test report as an artifact:
   - Using the `actions/upload-artifact@v3` action.
   - This step is always executed regardless of the success or failure of previous steps.
   - The artifact is named `jest-report`
   - It is located at path `jest-report/`
   - It is retained for 7 days.

#### Workflow for Playwright üé≠

- Workflow file: [playwright.yml](.github/workflows/playwright.yml)
- View the results on GitHub: [actions/workflows/playwright.yml](https://github.com/krsiakdaniel/portfolio-website-krsiak-cz/actions/workflows/playwright.yml)

4. Install Playwright browsers using `npx playwright install --with-deps`.
5. Run Playwright tests using `npx playwright test`.
6. Upload the test report as an artifact:
   - Using the `actions/upload-artifact@v3` action.
   - This step is always executed regardless of the success or failure of previous steps.
   - The artifact is named `playwright-report`
